# InterHall-Data-Analysis-Event
Every year IIT Kharagpur organises Technology General Championships. The motive behind organizing this general Championships is to create a healthy competition among students and to build and develop their skills and to provide basic knowledge about how to solve problems when you will start working in a organisation. So, IIT Kharagpur also organizes Inter Hall Data Analytics Event Under the Strategy Cup.

So now on moving forward, We are provided with a classification problem in which we have to classify the type of Congestion which will ocuur. For more information, please go through Problem Statement file.


Congestion means the state of being congested. There are different types of congestion takes place in real life. So, In this problem is about network congestion, Network congestion in data networking and queueing theory is the reduced quality of service that occurs when a network node or link is carrying more data than it can handle. 
Typical effects include queueing delay, packet loss or the blocking of new connections. A consequence of congestion is that an incremental increase in offered load leads either only to a small increase or even a decrease in network throughput.

In train_upd.csv, the dataset for trainig is given and test.csv is provided for testing the model.

final_visualization.ipynb contains the visualization part and through this we can see that the data is completely randomized.

Final_code.ipynb contains the coding part regarding traing and testing of model. For checking the validation of our model, we calculated Matthew Correlation Coefficient(MCC_score) and achieved 0.73 MCC_score.
